See its docstring. ****************************************************************************PURPOSEReggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomnessto Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's notmaking his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public keyto which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed toReggie, he gives back a value which is computed completelydeterministically from the seed and the secret key.Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output wascorrectly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,the output is computationally indistinguishable to her from a uniformrandom sample from the output space.The purpose of this contract is to perform that verification. ****************************************************************************DESIGN NOTESThe VRF algorithm verified here satisfies the full unqiqueness, fullcollision resistance, and full pseudorandomness security properties.See \\\"SECURITY PROPERTIES\\\" below, andhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-3An elliptic curve point is generally represented in the solidity codeas a uint256[2], corresponding to its affine coordinates inGF(FIELD_SIZE).For the sake of efficiency, this implementation deviates from the specin some minor ways:- Keccak hash rather than the SHA256 hash recommended inhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5Keccak costs much less gas on the EVM, and provides similar security.- Secp256k1 curve instead of the P-256 or ED25519 curves recommended inhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5For curve-point multiplication, it's much cheaper to abuse ECRECOVER- hashToCurve recursively hashes until it finds a curve x-ordinate. Onthe EVM, this is slightly more efficient than the recommendation inhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.1.1step 5, to concatenate with a nonce then hash, and rehash with thenonce updated until a valid x-ordinate is found.- hashToCurve does not include a cipher version string or the byte 0x1in the hash message, as recommended in step 5.B of the draftstandard. They are unnecessary here because no variation in thecipher suite is allowed.- Similarly, the hash input in scalarFromCurvePoints does not include acommitment to the cipher suite, either, which differs from step 2 ofhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.3. Also, the hash input is the concatenation of the uncompressedpoints, not the compressed points as recommended in step 3.- In the calculation of the challenge value \\\"c\\\", the \\\"u\\\" value (i.e.the value computed by Reggie as the nonce times the secp256k1generator point, see steps 5 and 7 ofhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3) is replaced by its ethereum address, i.e. the lower 160 bits of thekeccak hash of the original u. This is because we only verify thecalculation of u up to its address, by abusing ECRECOVER. ****************************************************************************SECURITY PROPERTIESHere are the security properties for this VRF:Full uniqueness: For any seed and valid VRF public key, there isexactly one VRF output which can be proved to come from that seed, inthe sense that the proof will pass verifyVRFProof.Full collision resistance: It's cryptographically infeasible to findtwo seeds with same VRF output from a fixed, valid VRF keyFull pseudorandomness: Absent the proofs that the VRF outputs arederived from a given seed, the outputs are computationallyindistinguishable from randomness.https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf, Appendix B contains the proofsfor these properties.For secp256k1, the key validation described in sectionhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.6is unnecessary, because secp256k1 has cofactor 1, and therepresentation of the public key used here (affine x- and y-ordinatesof the secp256k1 point on the standard y^2=x^3+7 curve) cannot refer tothe point at infinity. ****************************************************************************OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONSThe seed input to the VRF could in principle force an arbitrary amountof work in hashToCurve, by requiring extra rounds of hashing andchecking whether that's yielded the x ordinate of a secp256k1 point.However, under the Random Oracle Model the probability of choosing apoint which forces n extra rounds in hashToCurve is 2\\u207b\\u207f. The base costfor calling hashToCurve is about 25,000 gas, and each round of checkingfor a valid x ordinate costs about 15,555 gas, so to find a seed forwhich hashToCurve would cost more than 2,017,000 gas, one would have totry, in expectation, about 2\\u00b9\\u00b2\\u2078 seeds, which is infeasible for anyforseeable computational resources. (25,000 + 128 * 15,555 < 2,017,000.)Since the gas block limit for the Ethereum main net is 10,000,000 gas,this means it is infeasible for an adversary to prevent correctoperation of this contract by choosing an adverse seed.(See TestMeasureHashToCurveGasCost for verification of the gas cost forhashToCurve.)It may be possible to make a secure constant-time hashToCurve function.See notes in hashToCurve docstring.\",\"methods\":{}},\"userdoc\":{\"methods\":{},\"notice\":\"****************************************************************************Verification of verifiable-random-function (VRF) proofs, followinghttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3See https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf for security proofs.\"}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"/home/osboxes/BoskeDAO/BOSKE-raffle/contracts/vrf/VRF.sol\":\"VRF\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"/home/osboxes/BoskeDAO/BOSKE-raffle/contracts/vrf/VRF.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1199ca88caa3c08e8459cb92455a59a646ff4454b149cf64d4edbbafb34c9e4a\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://646ce83fa51da93afd6c32ce9701bbb3271bfe420cd677d75a3f7234cff4498b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQ586GqkKfWsGQPrpAoK9m4ZJTzCjLfqRkwMo4mVSXc86\"]}},\"version\":1}",

See its docstring.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev PURPOSE\n@dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness\n@dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not\n@dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key\n@dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n@dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n@dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n@dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n@dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n@dev the output is computationally indistinguishable to her from a uniform\n@dev random sample from the output space.\n@dev The purpose of this contract is to perform that verification.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev DESIGN NOTES\n@dev The VRF algorithm verified here satisfies the full unqiqueness, full\n@dev collision resistance, and full pseudorandomness security properties.\n@dev See \"SECURITY PROPERTIES\" below, and\n@dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-3\n@dev An elliptic curve point is generally represented in the solidity code\n@dev as a uint256[2], corresponding to its affine coordinates in\n@dev GF(FIELD_SIZE).\n@dev For the sake of efficiency, this implementation deviates from the spec\n@dev in some minor ways:\n@dev - Keccak hash rather than the SHA256 hash recommended in\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5\n@dev   Keccak costs much less gas on the EVM, and provides similar security.\n@dev - Secp256k1 curve instead of the P-256 or ED25519 curves recommended in\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5\n@dev   For curve-point multiplication, it's much cheaper to abuse ECRECOVER\n@dev - hashToCurve recursively hashes until it finds a curve x-ordinate. On\n@dev   the EVM, this is slightly more efficient than the recommendation in\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.1.1\n@dev   step 5, to concatenate with a nonce then hash, and rehash with the\n@dev   nonce updated until a valid x-ordinate is found.\n@dev - hashToCurve does not include a cipher version string or the byte 0x1\n@dev   in the hash message, as recommended in step 5.B of the draft\n@dev   standard. They are unnecessary here because no variation in the\n@dev   cipher suite is allowed.\n@dev - Similarly, the hash input in scalarFromCurvePoints does not include a\n@dev   commitment to the cipher suite, either, which differs from step 2 of\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.3\n@dev   . Also, the hash input is the concatenation of the uncompressed\n@dev   points, not the compressed points as recommended in step 3.\n@dev - In the calculation of the challenge value \"c\", the \"u\" value (i.e.\n@dev   the value computed by Reggie as the nonce times the secp256k1\n@dev   generator point, see steps 5 and 7 of\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3\n@dev   ) is replaced by its ethereum address, i.e. the lower 160 bits of the\n@dev   keccak hash of the original u. This is because we only verify the\n@dev   calculation of u up to its address, by abusing ECRECOVER.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev   SECURITY PROPERTIES\n@dev Here are the security properties for this VRF:\n@dev Full uniqueness: For any seed and valid VRF public key, there is\n@dev   exactly one VRF output which can be proved to come from that seed, in\n@dev   the sense that the proof will pass verifyVRFProof.\n@dev Full collision resistance: It's cryptographically infeasible to find\n@dev   two seeds with same VRF output from a fixed, valid VRF key\n@dev Full pseudorandomness: Absent the proofs that the VRF outputs are\n@dev   derived from a given seed, the outputs are computationally\n@dev   indistinguishable from randomness.\n@dev https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf, Appendix B contains the proofs\n@dev for these properties.\n@dev For secp256k1, the key validation described in section\n@dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.6\n@dev is unnecessary, because secp256k1 has cofactor 1, and the\n@dev representation of the public key used here (affine x- and y-ordinates\n@dev of the secp256k1 point on the standard y^2=x^3+7 curve) cannot refer to\n@dev the point at infinity.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n  * @dev The seed input to the VRF could in principle force an arbitrary amount\n@dev of work in hashToCurve, by requiring extra rounds of hashing and\n@dev checking whether that's yielded the x ordinate of a secp256k1 point.\n@dev However, under the Random Oracle Model the probability of choosing a\n@dev point which forces n extra rounds in hashToCurve is 2⁻ⁿ. The base cost\n@dev for calling hashToCurve is about 25,000 gas, and each round of checking\n@dev for a valid x ordinate costs about 15,555 gas, so to find a seed for\n@dev which hashToCurve would cost more than 2,017,000 gas, one would have to\n@dev try, in expectation, about 2¹²⁸ seeds, which is infeasible for any\n@dev forseeable computational resources. (25,000 + 128 * 15,555 < 2,017,000.)\n@dev Since the gas block limit for the Ethereum main net is 10,000,000 gas,\n@dev this means it is infeasible for an adversary to prevent correct\n@dev operation of this contract by choosing an adverse seed.\n@dev (See TestMeasureHashToCurveGasCost for verification of the gas cost for\n@dev hashToCurve.)\n@dev It may be possible to make a secure constant-time hashToCurve function.\n@dev See notes in hashToCurve docstring."

See its docstring.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev PURPOSE\n@dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness\n@dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not\n@dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key\n@dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n@dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n@dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n@dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n@dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n@dev the output is computationally indistinguishable to her from a uniform\n@dev random sample from the output space.\n@dev The purpose of this contract is to perform that verification.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev DESIGN NOTES\n@dev The VRF algorithm verified here satisfies the full unqiqueness, full\n@dev collision resistance, and full pseudorandomness security properties.\n@dev See \"SECURITY PROPERTIES\" below, and\n@dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-3\n@dev An elliptic curve point is generally represented in the solidity code\n@dev as a uint256[2], corresponding to its affine coordinates in\n@dev GF(FIELD_SIZE).\n@dev For the sake of efficiency, this implementation deviates from the spec\n@dev in some minor ways:\n@dev - Keccak hash rather than the SHA256 hash recommended in\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5\n@dev   Keccak costs much less gas on the EVM, and provides similar security.\n@dev - Secp256k1 curve instead of the P-256 or ED25519 curves recommended in\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5\n@dev   For curve-point multiplication, it's much cheaper to abuse ECRECOVER\n@dev - hashToCurve recursively hashes until it finds a curve x-ordinate. On\n@dev   the EVM, this is slightly more efficient than the recommendation in\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.1.1\n@dev   step 5, to concatenate with a nonce then hash, and rehash with the\n@dev   nonce updated until a valid x-ordinate is found.\n@dev - hashToCurve does not include a cipher version string or the byte 0x1\n@dev   in the hash message, as recommended in step 5.B of the draft\n@dev   standard. They are unnecessary here because no variation in the\n@dev   cipher suite is allowed.\n@dev - Similarly, the hash input in scalarFromCurvePoints does not include a\n@dev   commitment to the cipher suite, either, which differs from step 2 of\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.3\n@dev   . Also, the hash input is the concatenation of the uncompressed\n@dev   points, not the compressed points as recommended in step 3.\n@dev - In the calculation of the challenge value \"c\", the \"u\" value (i.e.\n@dev   the value computed by Reggie as the nonce times the secp256k1\n@dev   generator point, see steps 5 and 7 of\n@dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3\n@dev   ) is replaced by its ethereum address, i.e. the lower 160 bits of the\n@dev   keccak hash of the original u. This is because we only verify the\n@dev   calculation of u up to its address, by abusing ECRECOVER.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev   SECURITY PROPERTIES\n@dev Here are the security properties for this VRF:\n@dev Full uniqueness: For any seed and valid VRF public key, there is\n@dev   exactly one VRF output which can be proved to come from that seed, in\n@dev   the sense that the proof will pass verifyVRFProof.\n@dev Full collision resistance: It's cryptographically infeasible to find\n@dev   two seeds with same VRF output from a fixed, valid VRF key\n@dev Full pseudorandomness: Absent the proofs that the VRF outputs are\n@dev   derived from a given seed, the outputs are computationally\n@dev   indistinguishable from randomness.\n@dev https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf, Appendix B contains the proofs\n@dev for these properties.\n@dev For secp256k1, the key validation described in section\n@dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.6\n@dev is unnecessary, because secp256k1 has cofactor 1, and the\n@dev representation of the public key used here (affine x- and y-ordinates\n@dev of the secp256k1 point on the standard y^2=x^3+7 curve) cannot refer to\n@dev the point at infinity.\n****************************************************************************\n@dev OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n  * @dev The seed input to the VRF could in principle force an arbitrary amount\n@dev of work in hashToCurve, by requiring extra rounds of hashing and\n@dev checking whether that's yielded the x ordinate of a secp256k1 point.\n@dev However, under the Random Oracle Model the probability of choosing a\n@dev point which forces n extra rounds in hashToCurve is 2⁻ⁿ. The base cost\n@dev for calling hashToCurve is about 25,000 gas, and each round of checking\n@dev for a valid x ordinate costs about 15,555 gas, so to find a seed for\n@dev which hashToCurve would cost more than 2,017,000 gas, one would have to\n@dev try, in expectation, about 2¹²⁸ seeds, which is infeasible for any\n@dev forseeable computational resources. (25,000 + 128 * 15,555 < 2,017,000.)\n@dev Since the gas block limit for the Ethereum main net is 10,000,000 gas,\n@dev this means it is infeasible for an adversary to prevent correct\n@dev operation of this contract by choosing an adverse seed.\n@dev (See TestMeasureHashToCurveGasCost for verification of the gas cost for\n@dev hashToCurve.)\n@dev It may be possible to make a secure constant-time hashToCurve function.\n@dev See notes in hashToCurve docstring."

    "details": "Bibliographic references:Goldberg, et al., \"Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)\", Internet Draftdraft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05, IETF, Aug 11 2019,https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05Papadopoulos, et al., \"Making NSEC5 Practical for DNSSEC\", CryptologyePrint Archive, Report 2017/099, https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf ****************************************************************************USAGEThe main entry point is randomValueFromVRFProof. See its docstring. ****************************************************************************PURPOSEReggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomnessto Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's notmaking his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public keyto which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed toReggie, he gives back a value which is computed completelydeterministically from the seed and the secret key.Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output wascorrectly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,the output is computationally indistinguishable to her from a uniformrandom sample from the output space.The purpose of this contract is to perform that verification. ****************************************************************************DESIGN NOTESThe VRF algorithm verified here satisfies the full unqiqueness, fullcollision resistance, and full pseudorandomness security properties.See \"SECURITY PROPERTIES\" below, andhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-3An elliptic curve point is generally represented in the solidity codeas a uint256[2], corresponding to its affine coordinates inGF(FIELD_SIZE).For the sake of efficiency, this implementation deviates from the specin some minor ways:- Keccak hash rather than the SHA256 hash recommended inhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5Keccak costs much less gas on the EVM, and provides similar security.- Secp256k1 curve instead of the P-256 or ED25519 curves recommended inhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5For curve-point multiplication, it's much cheaper to abuse ECRECOVER- hashToCurve recursively hashes until it finds a curve x-ordinate. Onthe EVM, this is slightly more efficient than the recommendation inhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.1.1step 5, to concatenate with a nonce then hash, and rehash with thenonce updated until a valid x-ordinate is found.- hashToCurve does not include a cipher version string or the byte 0x1in the hash message, as recommended in step 5.B of the draftstandard. They are unnecessary here because no variation in thecipher suite is allowed.- Similarly, the hash input in scalarFromCurvePoints does not include acommitment to the cipher suite, either, which differs from step 2 ofhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.3. Also, the hash input is the concatenation of the uncompressedpoints, not the compressed points as recommended in step 3.- In the calculation of the challenge value \"c\", the \"u\" value (i.e.the value computed by Reggie as the nonce times the secp256k1generator point, see steps 5 and 7 ofhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3) is replaced by its ethereum address, i.e. the lower 160 bits of thekeccak hash of the original u. This is because we only verify thecalculation of u up to its address, by abusing ECRECOVER. ****************************************************************************SECURITY PROPERTIESHere are the security properties for this VRF:Full uniqueness: For any seed and valid VRF public key, there isexactly one VRF output which can be proved to come from that seed, inthe sense that the proof will pass verifyVRFProof.Full collision resistance: It's cryptographically infeasible to findtwo seeds with same VRF output from a fixed, valid VRF keyFull pseudorandomness: Absent the proofs that the VRF outputs arederived from a given seed, the outputs are computationallyindistinguishable from randomness.https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf, Appendix B contains the proofsfor these properties.For secp256k1, the key validation described in sectionhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.6is unnecessary, because secp256k1 has cofactor 1, and therepresentation of the public key used here (affine x- and y-ordinatesof the secp256k1 point on the standard y^2=x^3+7 curve) cannot refer tothe point at infinity. ****************************************************************************OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONSThe seed input to the VRF could in principle force an arbitrary amountof work in hashToCurve, by requiring extra rounds of hashing andchecking whether that's yielded the x ordinate of a secp256k1 point.However, under the Random Oracle Model the probability of choosing apoint which forces n extra rounds in hashToCurve is 2⁻ⁿ. The base costfor calling hashToCurve is about 25,000 gas, and each round of checkingfor a valid x ordinate costs about 15,555 gas, so to find a seed forwhich hashToCurve would cost more than 2,017,000 gas, one would have totry, in expectation, about 2¹²⁸ seeds, which is infeasible for anyforseeable computational resources. (25,000 + 128 * 15,555 < 2,017,000.)Since the gas block limit for the Ethereum main net is 10,000,000 gas,this means it is infeasible for an adversary to prevent correctoperation of this contract by choosing an adverse seed.(See TestMeasureHashToCurveGasCost for verification of the gas cost forhashToCurve.)It may be possible to make a secure constant-time hashToCurve function.See notes in hashToCurve docstring.",
